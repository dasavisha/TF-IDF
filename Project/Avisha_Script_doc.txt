Experiment 1: Extraction of Frequencies of words in Lexicon in the document
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. python pos_lex_extraction.py <name_of_lexicon> <text_file> <out_file>
Requirements: The necessary lexicon and the document in .txt format 
Problem: It catches all occurences of the word, and catches first occurence.

Experiment 2: Running Naive Bayes Classifier
-----------------------------------------------------
2. python classification_script.py Real_train.csv Real_test.csv > output_NB.txt
Requirements: The Training file in csv format and testing file in csv format; Softwares: TextBlob package  
Problem: It does the classification using a prebuilt Naive Bayes Classifier

Experiment 3: Feature Extraction for the SVM file
----------------------------------------------------
3. python feature_extractor_2.py model_file.csv Train_file.csv Train_file.svm
Requirements: The training file can be used as the model file. Then used a training file to convert it to the svm format and similarly the test file.
Software Requirements: NLTK, SciKit Learn

Experiment 4: Running the SVM
--------------------------------
4. svm_learn training_file model_file
   svm_classify svm_classify test_file model_file output_file
Requirements: Training File and testing file in SVM format. 
Software: SVMLight for Windows
